## Why this project exists
This project arose from the idea of turning a small part of freelance project I did a long time ago into a library. With TinderLike Cards library, you can easily have a tinder-style design. Since the project was written in the past, it may have problems. I will continue to improve the library with your help. Please be sure to report any issues you find. I took the structure of listview as an example for myself. You can easily include it in your project with the use of a simple adapter.
