# Overlayer

Thanks to this application, you can add and edit beautiful effects on your photos.

## Why this project exists

This project was written simply for the purpose of how to independently add and edit a photo on top
of another photo. In addition, arrangements have been made to ensure maximum efficiency for listing
and offline use. For the cache system, blobs are used instead of ready-made libraries.
